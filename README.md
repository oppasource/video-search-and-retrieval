# video-search-and-retrieval

This project demonstrates how vector database can be used to search and retrieve videos.

We download 4 sample videos from youtube and build a search for them. It allows us to search and also start playing the video from that timestamp directly based on user query.

Libraries used are:
- Qdrant: for vector db
- Whisper: to get video transcripts
- Sentence Transformer: to get vectors of text
